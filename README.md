# L_Systems
Generating artwork using L-Systems

## General
L-System is a formal language that was invented by Aristid Lindenmayer to model the growth and evolution of plants. It was also found useful in generating geometries such as fractals, space-filling curves and tiles.

The code was implemented in R

## Stage I
First I generated artwork using available rules and added my touch of aesthetics

**Penrose tiling**

## Stage II
I then generated artwork by randomly producing re-writing rules and curated interesting outcomes
